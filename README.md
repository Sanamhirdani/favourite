# favourite and An amazing actor
my favourite actor is girish kumar.An ethnic Sindhi,[4] Girish was signed in the Bollywood romance film Ramaiya Vastavaiya, directed by Prabhu Deva and produced by his father Kumar S. Taurani, who is the managing director of Tips Industries Limited. In this film he played the role of Ram, a foreigner who was very rich, his role showed how agile and open his character truly is. Prabhu Deva trained Girish for three and a half years before the filming. To launch Girish, Prabhu Deva was signed close to three years back. Prabhu Deva decided to have an audition for him. As a result, Girish had to perform on a few scenes and also a dance number. Prabhu loved his performance, and thought that Girish had an X factor; he only needed to just polish some rough edges and become more spontaneous. He talked with his parents about giving him some dancing training and later, he selected some 25 songs and gave them to Girish so that he could practice upon them. He also appointed a few choreographers who worked on a daily basis with Girish in order to prepare him well for all formats of dances that were required for films.
